todo:
-change audio output samples to 48kHz. or 96kHz? ... and 16bits
-implement analog stick functionality. perhaps X and Y control ... amplitude + pitch?
-interface with better DAC. with I2S, none of this I2C BS.
-interface with ATTINY for polling (use SPI)
-use signed integers instead of unsigned. and 16bits for audio output ..?
-ideally NO PAUSES during polling -- current iteration skips it to avoid polling noise
